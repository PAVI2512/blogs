                        <p>Eating is something that I love and enjoy greatly, I love to try new foods and explore new recipes with my girlfriend. We generally try to make one new recipe each week.  I am not a very picky eater, however, there are some foods that I do not enjoy at all, such as asparagus, mushrooms, and brussels sprouts. Most people sit down and have three larger meals a day along with some snacks. I donâ€™t eat very much at one time. Generally, I will eat two eggs in the morning, half a sandwich for lunch with salad or another side, and for dinner I will have a regular sized portion of whatever we decide to cook that night. I do enjoy snacking on little things like crackers throughout the day as well. My eating habits revolve around a busy schedule; I am a full time student and I have two jobs. So, I spend a lot of time eating in my car or at work. I work with a little boy who is non-verbal and has autism. He is quite a handful; whenever I am with him I need something I can eat quickly such as a sandwich, piece of fruit, or a protein bar.  I generally try to eat fairly healthy when I can, which is often hard being so busy and not having a lot of money. To go back to where my eating habits all started. When I was younger my family ate a lot of processed foods. My mom was gone on business trips a lot. So, that left my dad in charge for taking care of my brother and I; he was not the best cook. We would eat things such as ham steak, pasta, ring dings, and even hotdogs from a can. </p>
